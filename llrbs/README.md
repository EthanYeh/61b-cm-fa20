# Fixing a 2-3/LLRB Tree Problem Meta

For this problem, students should become more comfortable with performing LLRB balancing operations and converting between 2-3 trees and their LLRB counterparts. 

## Introducing the problem
Make sure that students are conceptually clear on how a LLRB is an equivalent representation of a 2-3 tree. Review the LLRB rotation and flip operations so that students know what they can use to fix the tree. 

## Solution
Although the solution begins by fixing all of the invalid LLRB nodes before moving on to converting the 2-3 nodes, students may have an easier time fixing the tree by doing the latter first. This way, the problem is then simplified to converting between a 2-3 tree and its LLRB counterpart.
